# julia_theosysbio

In this repository I will develop and maintain a set of [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) notebooks showing how we can use [Julia](https://julialang.org)
for theoretical and computational systems biology options.

The collection of notebooks will deal with the following topics

1. Basic overview of types and control structures
2. Packages and plotting
3. Functions and programming
4. Types and speed
5. DataFrames and statistical data analysis
6. Computational statistics
7. Dynamical Systems
8. Basic bioinformatics in *Julia*

These notebooks are meant to support --- in the first instance --- the Maths/Stats lectures of the [MSc in Bioinformatics and 
Theoretical Systems Biology](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/life-sciences/bioinformatics/), but hopefully others find them useful, too.
Examples will almost exclusively be chosen from computational and mathematical biology, or problems in statistical bioinformatics and 
computational statistics.
